# Welcome to Gradient CSS

### Gradient CSS was inspired by UIGradients.com and it was generated into this CSS.

### How it works?
1. Add Gradient CSS before `</head>` in your template example: 
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/gradient.min.css">
```
2. Pick a background name from UIgradient.com and if it was 2 words you can separate it with - (hypen) ex: `facebook-messanger`
3. Add it as class ex: `<div class="facebook-messanger> Gradient CSS Background will shown as background </div>`
4. Enjoy!.
