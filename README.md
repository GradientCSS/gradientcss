# Welcome to Gradient CSS

## Gradient CSS was inspired by UIGradients.com and it was generated into this CSS.

### Download Gradient CSS
- [Gradient CSS for Development](https://www.craftbootstrap.com/css/gradient.css "Uncompressed Gradient CSS")
- [Gradient CSS Minified](https://www.craftbootstrap.com/css/gradient.min.css "Minified Gradient CSS")
    
### How it works?
1. After download the files Add Gradient CSS before `</head>` in your template example: ```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/gradient.min.css">```
2. Pick a background name from UIgradient.com and if it was 2 words you can separate it with - (hypen) ex: `facebook-messanger`
3. Add it as class ex: `<div class="facebook-messanger> Gradient CSS Background will shown as background </div>`
4. Enjoy!.
